Deep Neural Network-Based Age &amp; Gender Detection  in Security and Surveillance video 


Age and gender are two important characteristics that play an important role in relationships and make it possible to estimate age and gender by analyzing video films. Access control is an important function in intelligent applications such as human-computer interaction, crime intelligence, visual inspection, and interaction analysis. This paper uses deep learning technology using OpenCV (open-source computer vision library) to conduct research on age estimation and gender estimation in crowd research. This method uses convolutional neural networks to recognize facial features to achieve accurate age and gender classification. Using the Haar Cascades method for face recognition, followed by extraction and classification first using a CNN model. After it detects an object or a face, it looks at the person's face to determine how old they might be and whether they are female or male. Computer vision techniques help analyze video, and deep learning models (a form of artificial intelligence) are used to estimate age and gender from facial information accurately. The goal is to make it fast and accurate to be useful in real life. Video Surveillance data is processed using various computer vision techniques to extract meaningful statistical information. It helps monitoring unauthorized access to restrict areas.
